# GetTwitterData
finalProjectDE2022
This Project follows antisemitism tweets on Twitter

For the final project in big data engineer course, we developed the project. 
During our project planning, 
we connected with the volunteers of an association that fight anti-Semitism on social networks. 
We learned from them about the process they do, and based the project on this work process.
We focused on the Twitter network because it has an API for developers, 
which allows automation of the manual steps done by the dedicated volunteers.

all the right recevied to Karmit Goren & Henya Binder 2022.
